# IIPC-front

The directory template being used is a stanardized convention. 
- index.html - the home page
- resources/ - for files created locally by us
- vendors/ - for files taken from the internet - do not edit, only add newer ones if needed! 

I haven't used bootstrap for the home page. All atributes were coded in `resources/css/style.css`

For all other pages, it'd be better to have a separate css file than style.css so that you can use bootstrap without affecting the home page

# How to run on local server

- Clone the repo locally
- Download `nodejs` from here: [Link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Open command prompt in the cloned folder and install http-server module by typing `npm install http-server`
- After installation ends, type in `http-server -p 80` (You can change 80 to whatever number upto 9999 you want)
- Browse to localhost on your browser or 127.0.0.1

Thanks
