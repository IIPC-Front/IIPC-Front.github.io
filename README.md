# IIPC-front

The directory template being used is a stanardized convention. 
- index.html - the home page
- resources/ - for files created locally by us
- vendors/ - for files taken from the internet - do not edit, only add newer ones if needed! 

I haven't used bootstrap for the home page. All atributes were coded in resources/css/style.css

For all other pages, it'd be better to have a separate css file than style.css so that you can use bootstrap without affecting the home page

Thanks
